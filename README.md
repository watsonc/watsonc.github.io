# Colin Watson

 I am an Economics PhD candidate at the University of Michigan. My research is in applied microeconomics with a focus on structural models of search and price discrimination.

I am on the job market in 2019-2020 and am available for interviews at the 2020 ASSA meeting in San Diego and the NABE TEC2019 conference in Seattle.
